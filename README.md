Beaver-Flood Event Detector (B-FED) 

Functionality of Script
=================
B-FED Tool Kit: 
B-FED is a Google Earth Engine script that uses NASA Earth Observations, a MassGIS 
wetland polygon layer, citizen science Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) Data 
and remote sensing methodology to detect floodig events that are likely caused by beavers 
in Massachusetts, USA. The objective of this kit is to have an algorithm with conditional 
statements to determine for a given year if flooding, based on spectral signatures, caused 
by beavers has occurred. This is then filtered for a wetland layer and then inlaid with citizen 
science data of beaver observations from GBIF. The correlation of having flooding, 
along with reported beaver observations acts as a validation for the tool. B-FED is divided into 
three scripts.
